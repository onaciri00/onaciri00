# Hi, I'm Oussama Naciri! 👋

I am a passionate software engineer specializing in full-stack web development. My coding journey has taken me through both low-level and high-level programming, as well as system-level development. However, it is the world of web development—both back-end and front-end—that truly captures my interest! Nothing compares to the satisfaction of crafting responsive, intuitive, and dynamic web interfaces that deliver exceptional user experiences.

## 🚀 My skills:

- ✨ I began my journey by solving problems using C and C++, relying solely on what you might call "vanilla C" to build a strong foundation in programming.
- 🌐 Front-End Development: Skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build responsive, user-friendly web applications.
- 🌐 Back-End Development: Proficient in Python programming with expertise in Django and Django Rest Framework, enabling me to build robust, scalable, and efficient server-side solutions. Additionally, I have strong experience working with PostgreSQL for database management and integration.
- I have extensive experience with Docker, from building images from scratch to deploying and managing them using Docker Compose.
- 🌐 Using Nginx is essential in the web development world, but my teammates and I took it a step further by creating a simple web server capable of handling GET, POST, and other useful HTTP methods.
- 🤝  am a proud member of the global 42 network and the 1337 community, actively contributing to the tech world and fostering innovation.
